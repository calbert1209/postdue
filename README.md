## Setup

### Install Deno ðŸ¦•

See the Deno website for
[installation instructions](https://deno.land/manual@v1.25.0/getting_started/installation)
or live wild and just install it cuz some dude with a beard told you to:

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

# or via brew
$ brew install deno
```

### Instal Veloceraptor ðŸ¦–

[Veloceraptor](https://velociraptor.run/) is a Deno tool that executes scripts
similar to the way `npm` or `yarn` can execute tasks in the `"scripts"` section
of a `package.json` file. You'll need it to execute the scripts setup in
`scripts.yaml`.

```bash
$ deno install -qAn vr https://deno.land/x/velociraptor@1.5.0/cli.ts
```
